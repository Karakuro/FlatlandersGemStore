# FlatlandersGemStore
The Flatlanders Gems store, an asp.net web.api 2 Kata

The Flatlanders family needs a store to sell the gems coming from their shady dealings; 
they are evil and dangerous so you need to do a good job otherwise it is better that you start to watch your back!

This simple store needs two main areas:
- The Store section to sell the gems and make money 
- The Admin section to manage the gems warehouse


######STORE SECTION WEB API:
- list and look for gems
- Get a gem Detail info
- Buy a Gem  (attention to the gem availability)
- Write a Review


######ADMIN SECTION WEB API:  (ATTENTION....only admins can enter here)
- List and look for gems
- Add a gem
- Update a gem
- Publish / unpublish a gem (to make it visible on store)


GOOD LUCK!
